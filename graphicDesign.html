                    For this project, I used processing and data to create a wearable object that signifies
                    my dream of seeing my parents and friends abroad at will. The idea is that each feather 
                    symbolizes my relationship with a friend or family member. The width of each diagonal is
                    determined by how far the person lives away from me and the time difference between our
                    cities.

                    A public intervention on Penn's campus, this lenticular poster explores the theme of academic pressure.
                    On their way in, students are put in the perspective of "Home Sweet Home," which could be interpreted
                    with a sarcastic or playful tone. On their way in, the perspective changes to underscore the efforts
                    students put into their work and time spent in the building.

                    The objective of this student project was to design a unique street sign. Noticing how often 
                    people take selfies, I decided to exaggerate the phenomenon by making a warning sign of falling 
                    off the cliff accidentally for his selfie and ironically still laughing in the photo.

                    This design was loosely based on the idea of despair. The image could be interpreted as the wing flying
                    out of the abyss or as it failing to escape the abyss and shattering into little pieces.
