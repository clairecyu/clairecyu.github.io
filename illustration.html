                    This is a pair of illustrations inspired by the three types of animals:
                    doves, wolves, and red pandas. While the first depicts a mythical creature formed

                    in an imaginary landscape.

                    A study from photograph, this illustration is my first attempt at drawing with a 
                    more realistic style. I focused on adjusting my brushstroke to distinguish between
                    the character's body above and under water. It was a valuable experience for me to 
                    stay away from overrelying on contour.

                    <span> The Forbidden Palace <br><br></span>

                    This illustration depicts the Forbidden Palace of China with an imaginary 
                    background. It was inspired by my trip to the Forbidden Palace last year, 
                    during which I was amazed by the color scheme of the architecture. The overwhelming
                    presence of bright red paint was surprisingly harmonious with other vibrant colors. 
                    Therefore, I decided to challenge myself and try out a more vibrant palatte in This
                    illustration.

                    These are the my mock album cover designs  for the Neighbourhood's 
                    first album, I Love You. Given the irony between its angsty content and its cliche title, 
                    my design uses the play-on words- eye, heart, you- to emphasize the name and also the 
                    nature of the songs.

                    To best suit the content of the article, I illustrated a modern version of Jesus to highlight the satirical nature

                    Another editorial piece, this is a illustration of a fish chart for the most common commercial fish. It was

                    This is an earlier work of mine on character design, which depicts a little boy bathing in peanut butter. It
                    was inspired by my friend's crazy addiction to peanut butter. As one of my
                    earlier works, this illustration is of the Japanese manga style.

                   Another experiment on a more painterly style, this illustration depicts a wedding cake. It was 
                   my first time illustrating food and I must say, trying out various methods to depict the change in

                    This is a triptych depicting three scenes in Camus's book, the Stranger. 
                    The use of black and white linework emphasizes the sinister nature
